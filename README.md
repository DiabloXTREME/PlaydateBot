# Playdate
Playdate is a Discord bot that lets users sign in through Steam and register games that they have, so that choosing a game to play with friends is no longer a hassle! There are many future updates planned as well, incorporating server management features with tons of more game APIs!

## Development

Anybody can add an API or other functionality to Playdate! Currently in development is an addons system to allow easier development. You can make a repository of your own (and please do share!) or make a pull request into the Addons folder. (**WIP**)
